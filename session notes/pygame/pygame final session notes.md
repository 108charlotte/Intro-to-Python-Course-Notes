**Final Pygame Session**
Welcome to our final pygame session! 

Agenda
- 2:30-2:45: go over progress since last session and movement mechanics (left & right)
- 2:45-2:50: build out platforms with shapes, you can use textures for things but put them in the folder that your pygame file is in (this will make it work later on github)
- 2:50-3:20: create jump mechanic! 
- 3:20-3:30: put your code on github + add a README.md on how someone can run it! 

Thank you for attending this series, and I hope this was helpful!
